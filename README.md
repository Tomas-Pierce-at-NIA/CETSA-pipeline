## Summary

SenoCETSA is a program for the analysis of CETSA data.
It implements both the NPARC approach originally described in ref (Childs et al 2019),
and a method we call ITA which combines the correlated student tests of
different temperatures by Brown's method.
Our implementation of NPARC differs from the original by using permutation testing
for p-value generation instead of F-tests.
